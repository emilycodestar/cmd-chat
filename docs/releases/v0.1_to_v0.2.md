# CMD Chat v0.1 → v0.2 Delta

This note highlights the main differences between the original proof-of-concept release (v0.1) and the current hardened build (v0.2).

## Security Architecture
- RSA keys upgraded from 512 to 2048 bits and paired with AES-256/Fernet for data in transit.
- Each client now negotiates its own symmetric key to prevent cross-tenant leaks.
- Token-based access was added (UUIDv4 with configurable TTL, revocation API, and automatic cleanup).
- Optional IP validation and strict 10 KB / 1 MB message limits reduce trivial DoS attempts.
- TLS endpoints plus certificate validation are available for both server and client, enabling WSS in production.

## Server & Protocol Changes
- Message parsing migrated from `ast.literal_eval` to JSON helpers, closing the previous injection vector.
- Sanic handlers gained scoped try/except blocks with 10-second network timeouts and sanitized error responses.
- `/health` now returns live metrics (active users, message count, token usage) for monitoring.

## Client & UX Updates
- The CLI renderer now keeps connection metadata, timestamps, and status hints in sync with the reduced update interval.
- Prompt handling was rewritten so users no longer need a double ENTER to send messages and background updates feel faster.
- SSL-aware connection flags let the client automatically choose `ws://` or `wss://` based on CLI options.

## Tooling & Operations
- Dedicated diagnostics scripts (`check_messages.py`, `debug_messages.py`, `test_security.py`) were grouped under `test/`.
- Batch automation moved into `scripts/run_diagnostics.bat` to avoid cluttering the repository root.
- Server restarts, token management instructions, and SSL how-tos were consolidated in `docs/SECURITY.md`.

## Documentation Cleanup
- README, ROADMAP, and security notes were translated to English, stripped of emojis, and aligned with the new feature set.
- This `docs/releases/` directory tracks historical changes beginning with the v0.1 → v0.2 transition.

For a detailed roadmap of upcoming items, refer to `ROADMAP.md`. Security deployment guidance lives in `docs/SECURITY.md`.

> Note: these updates started as an independent audit of the original proof-of-concept. Feel free to cherry-pick what helps and drop anything that does not match the maintainer's vision.
